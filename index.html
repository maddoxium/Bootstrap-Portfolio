                              My name is Matthew , I am a Full Stack Web Developer. When it comes to my job I always make sure to always put in my best effort due to my professional life being important to me. I always do my best to catch up to where I need to be in a job, since in my experience every job is a team effort and I cannot be weighing everyone else down. I really want to move up in this world , to be able to be the best that I can so I would love to improve any way I can. I would much prefer to work on the back end of things, since I honestly donâ€™t have much of a knack for making things look particularly pleasing. I much prefer watching my less pretty things function perfectly than just have a sparkling page that does nothing. That is the perk of working on a team, is being able to play to your strengths. I have learned to be quite adaptable though so if something along the lines of front end would cross my plate, I would not turn my nose up at it. A challenge is perfectly fine as long as it can further my position as much as it can.  I have quite the knack of getting things done the way that they are supposed to be, to go outside the lines on certain things ends up causing more issues than not. I am very friendly in the workplace, and tend to be fairly easy to get along with. I have a friendly demeanor which has helped me in the past since it also allowed me to talk with customers and figure out whatever need , needs to be met. In short I am a hard worker , and before long I will be someone very hard to replace.
